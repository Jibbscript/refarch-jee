# Hybrid Connectivity

Hybrid cloud solutions are those that span beyond a single cloud instance. These solutions can encompass applications whose components are split across cloud and on-premises environments, or across different clouds -- even across different cloud providers. Hybrid cloud solutions must consider issues of connectivity, latency, and standardisation across clouds, vendors, and application design. Hybrid cloud applications also must integrate with mission-critical on-premises systems of record. A successful hybrid solution must connect seamlessly to existing enterprise integration capabilities and run without preoccupation as to where the components actually reside, on-premises or native. Capabilities such as APIs, events and messaging, data integration, and security are pivotal in hybrid integration.
