# Enterprise Application Modernization through Java EE on Cloud

## Phase 1 - Modernizing the Existing Application

Prescriptive WebSphere guidance provides a process for modernizing WebSphere applications through four steps:

1.  Plan
2.  Assess
3.  Source Migration
4.  Config Migration

That process is captured here for the transition from [Customer Order Services for WAS 7.0](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee-customerorder/tree/rad96-was70) to [Customer Order Serivces for WAS 8.5.5](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee-customerorder/tree/rad96-was855).
